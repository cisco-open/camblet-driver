nasp-kernel-module for Debian
----------------------------

The *nasp-kernel-module* is the supporting Linux kernel module for the [Nasp](https://github.com/cisco-open/nasp)
system. It is capable of enhancing plain old TCP sockets in a frictionless way so that application developers can
focus on their business logic instead of dealing with the complexity of TLS, mTLS, and other security-related concerns.
It is doing this seamlessly, no code changes or re-compilations or re-deployments are required.
